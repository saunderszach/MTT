For completeness here we present an alternative approach to solving the MTT problem with detection ambiguity. This MIO model is an extension to \eqref{eq:simple_robust} that directly determines the number of targets via optimization by incorporating additional variables and constraints into framework of the formulation. 

\subsection{Decision Variables}
Because we do not assume a fixed number of targets, this decision must now be made by the model. Toward this goal, we introduce a new binary decision variable $w_{j}$ to indicate whether or not trajectory \textit{j} corresponds to an existing target. Any detections assigned to a non-existing target would be a false alarm. 
\[w_{j} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if trajectory \textit{j} exists,}\\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]

\subsection{Constraints}
Most constraints remain similar to their original counterparts in \eqref{eq:simple_robust}, except for slight adjustments needed to account for the possibility that some trajectories may not exist. Explicitly, the number of possible trajectories is now $N_{1}$ so all instances of summing over \textit{j} must be changed accordingly. For example, we adjust \eqref{eqn: FA Simple} and \eqref{eqn: MD Total} as follows: 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{j=1}^{N_{1}} y_{itj} + F_{it} = 1 \qquad \forall i,t,\\
\sum_{j=1}^{N_{1}} \sum_{t=1}^{T} M_{jt} = TM.
\end{align*}

By the same accord \eqref{eq: } no longer equates to 1 because some trajectories may not exist. Therefore we say all \textit{existing} trajectories must either be assigned a detection or a missed detection,
\begin{align}\label{eqn: Existing Targets}
\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} y_{itj} + M_{jt} = w_{j} \qquad \forall j,t.
\end{align}

Moreover, we restrict $\alpha_{j}$ and $\beta_{j}$ to be zero if trajectory \textit{j} does not exist. This ensures only existing trajectories are penalized in the objective function. 
\begin{align*}
|\alpha_{j}|+|\beta_{j}| \leq M_{0}w_{j}\qquad \forall j.
\end{align*}

We can actually reduce the symmetry that is inherent to this formulation. Since $N_{0} \leq P \leq N_{1}$, we can set $w_j=1$ for all $j=1,\ldots,N_0$, which leaves us with only $N_1-N_0$ additional binary variables. We simply need the additional constraint
\begin{align*}
w_{N_0+1}\geq ...\geq w_{N_1},
\end{align*}
which reduces the symmetry of the formulation, and thus making it efficiently solvable. 

\subsection{MIO with Number of Targets as a Decision Variable}
Incorporating these additional variables and constraints, we arrive at the following complete alternative formulation.
\begin{align*}
\underset{\psi_{jt}}{\text{minimize: }} & \sum_{j=1}^{N_{1}} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \psi_{jt} + \theta \cdot TF + \phi \cdot TM\\
\text{subject to: }	& \sum_{j=1}^{N_{1}} y_{itj} + F_{it} = 1 \qquad \forall i,t \nonumber\\
				& \sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} y_{itj} + M_{jt} = 1 \qquad \forall j=1,...,N_{0},t \nonumber \\
				& \sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} y_{itj} + M_{jt} = w_{j} \qquad \forall j=N_{0},...,N_{1},t \nonumber \\
				& \sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} \sum_{t=1}^{T} F_{it} = TF \nonumber \\
				& \sum_{j=1}^{N_{1}} \sum_{t=1}^{T} M_{jt} = TM \nonumber \\
				& w_{N_0+1}\geq ...\geq w_{N_1} \nonumber \\
				& |\alpha_{j}|+|\beta_{j}| \leq M_{0}w_{j}\qquad \forall j \nonumber \\
				& x_{it}y_{itj} + M_{t}(1-y_{itj}) \geq z_{jt} \qquad \forall i,t,j \nonumber \\
				& x_{it}y_{itj} - M_{t}(1-y_{itj}) \leq z_{jt} \qquad \forall i,t,j \nonumber \\
				& z_{jt} - \alpha_{j} - \beta_{j}t \leq \psi_{jt} \qquad \forall j,t \nonumber \\
				& -(z_{jt} - \alpha_{j} - \beta_{j}t) \leq \psi_{jt} \qquad \forall j,t \nonumber \\
			 	& y_{itj} \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i,t,j \nonumber \\
				& \alpha_{j} \in \mathbb{R}^n,\quad \beta_{j} \in \mathbb{R}^n,\quad w_{j} \in \mathbb{R}^n \quad \forall j \nonumber \\
				& z_{jt} \in \mathbb{R}^n, \quad \forall j,t. \nonumber
\end{align*}

\subsection{Extension of Robust Heuristic}
Insert brief discussion about how this heuristic would be identical to the one proposed previously, except a number of estimated targets would be randomly selected during the initialization process and then the heuristic would progress identically to the robust heuristic already proposed.

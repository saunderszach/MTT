The field of multi-target tracking faces two primary challenges: (i) data association and (ii) trajectory estimation. Many algorithms such as the MHT and JPDAF attempt to solve the MTT problem via probabilistic approaches, while few utilize optimization. In this paper we introduce new mixed integer optimization (MIO) models which solve the data association and trajectory estimation problems simultaneously by minimizing an easily interpretable global objective function. In addition, we propose a greedy heuristic which quickly finds good solutions. We extend both the heuristic and the MIO model to scenarios with missed detections and false alarms. We show that the heuristic can be used effectively as a warmstart for the MIO. Furthermore, we show that both the MIO and heuristic show potential for use in an online sliding window algorithm, finding good results in real time for the application considered.

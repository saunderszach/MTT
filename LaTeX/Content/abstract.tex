Given a set of detections of targets over several time periods, we address in this paper the multi-target tracking problem (MTT) of optimally assigning detections to targets and estimating the trajectory of the targets over time. MTT has been addressed in the literature via predominantly probabilistic methods. In contract we propose mixed integer optimization (MIO) models and local search algorithms that are (a)  scalable as they provide near optimal solutions for red six targets and ten time periods in milliseconds to seconds, (b) general as they make no assumptions on the data, (c) robust as they can accommodate missed and false detections of the targets, (d) easily implementable as they use at most two tuning parameters. We evaluate the performance of the new methods using a new metric for complexity of an instance and find that they provide high quality solutions reliably and fast for a large range of scenarios, providing a promising approach to the area of MTT.

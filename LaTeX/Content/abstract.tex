The field of multi-target tracking faces two primary challenges: (i) data association and (ii) trajectory estimation. Many algorithms such as the MHT and JPDAF attempt to solve the MTT problem via probabilistic approaches, while few employ the use of optimization models. In this paper we take a new approach to the MTT problem by introducing new mixed integer optimization (MIO) models that rely on minimal assumptions. These models solve the data association and trajectory estimation problems simultaneously by minimizing an easily interpretable global objective function. In addition, we propose a greedy heuristic that scales efficiently and finds high quality solutions in milliseconds, and we show that these heuristic solutions can be used effectively as a warm start for the MIO.  We extend both the heuristic and the MIO model to scenarios with missed detections and false alarms. When there is no detection ambiguity \textit{i.e.}, no false alarms or missed detections, our models require no penalties, and once we allow for detection ambiguity our models require the use of only two easily understood penalties. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric for measuring complexity in the data association problem as well as a metric for measuring the performance of trajectory estimation. Finally, we test all of our methods in two experimental simulations, one with detection ambiguity and one without, and  we compare their performance with regards to randomized solutions and solutions with perfect data associations.

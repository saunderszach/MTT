We presented multi-target tracking approaches which jointly solve the problems of data association and trajectory estimation via global optimization methods using a single objective function. To this end, we proposed the use of a randomized local search heuristic as a warm start for a mixed integer optimization model, and we did so for scenarios with and without detection ambiguity. We accomplish this without the need of a trajectory bank nor the a prior computation of trajectory hypotheses. We showed that the heuristic finds good quality feasible solutions very quickly. We also show that the MIO offers improvement over the heuristic and this improvement is found in real time for applications considered by this paper.  The proposed methods show potential for use in an online algorithm with a sliding window, suggesting one possible extension for future work. Other extensions for future work could seek to expand the formulations to account for the birth/death of targets. Additionally, future research could explore the use of more complex penalty functions. One possible idea would be the use of piecewise linear functions which would require further expansion of our formulations.

In summary, we presented multi-target tracking approaches which jointly solve the problems of data association and trajectory estimation via global optimization methods using a single objective function. Toward this goal, we proposed the use of a randomized local search heuristic as a warm start for a mixed integer optimization model, and we did so for scenarios with and without detection ambiguity. We accomplish this without the need of a trajectory bank nor the prior computation of trajectory hypotheses. We showed that the heuristic finds good quality feasible solutions very quickly. We also show that the MIO offers improvement over the heuristic and this improvement is found in real time for applications considered by this paper.  

The proposed methods show potential for use in an online algorithm with a sliding window, suggesting one possible area of future work. Implementing the heuristic as sliding window algorithm would very likely mitigate this scaling effect in regards to $T$. Rather than solve all scans in a single batch at once, a sliding window algorithm solves a subset of scans, or a smaller window, and advances through all scans sequentially.  As the window progresses forward through the scans,``soft'' decisions are made meaning that the heuristic would begin with the decisions from the previous solution. As scans pass beyond the horizon and out of the sliding window, the decisions become fixed and we refer to them as ``hard" decisions. This process continues until all scans have been processed. The run times of a sliding window variant of the heuristic would not exhibit the curse of dimensionality in $T$ since the number of scans remains constant. Additionally, the heuristic is likely to produce higher quality solutions as a result of these ``soft" decisions of previous steps since it is starting from a solution which is likely to be better than a completely random solution. 

Additionally, future research could explore the use of more complex penalty functions. One possible idea would be the use of piecewise linear functions which would require further expansion of our formulations. Other areas of future work could seek to relax some of the scenario based assumptions made in Assumption~\ref{ass:general_assumption}, in particular, extensions to non-linear trajectories or the birth/death of targets.
